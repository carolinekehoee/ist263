    <p id="main">
        I am a <strong>double major</strong> in supply chain management and marketing management. I am interested in supply chain management because it's a fast-paced, deadline driven industry that involves critical thinking and I feel as though I would be great at it. It also touches on every step of a product or service from growing, mining, and creating a material to its end life. I am also interested in marketing management because I love to speak and interact with people and meeting the consumers needs. This is a more creative position that will blend well with my more analytical side.

        A few of my technology skills include Microsoft Excel Certification, Google Suite, and Canva. A few of my accomplishments are making the dean's list for the Fall of 2022, joining Phi Eta Sigma National Honor Society, and being given an SU Orange distinction award.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        I am a middle child and have an older sister and younger brother. I would say I am an extroverted introvert. I love being around friends and spending quality time with family; however, I do like to be on my own and be independent. I also love to play and watch sports since I grew up playing soccer, basketball, and lacrosse in high school.
