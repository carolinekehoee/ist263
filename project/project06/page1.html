    <p>
        Welcome to my travel blog and advice website for students studying abroad! My name is Caroline Kehoe, and I am a junior studying at Syracuse University. I recently studied abroad this past fall of 2022 through the Syracuse London program. I chose London out of all places for so many different reasons. The first, is that there is no language barrier which allows the transition from the US to the UK to be a bit smoother. The second is that London is said to have been very similar to New York City, which is a city I absolutely love. The third is that London has several major airports which makes traveling to nearby countries on the weekends very easy. Overall, it seemed like the most practical place to study abroad and potentially live and work in, in the near future. London will always have a special place in my heart. The people I have met, the restaurants and little cafes I went to, the football pride, the tube station, and much more are just a few reasons why I love this city and would move here tomorrow.
    </p>

        I was able to travel to seven other countries within a three-month period of being in Europe. I went to Lockerbie Scotland, Budapest Hungary, Vienna Austria, Copenhagen Denmark, Berlin Germany, Porto Portugal, and Zurich/Interlaken Switzerland. I included down below a few pictures of my trips that I adore very much!

    <h1>Lockerbie, Scotland</h1>
    <p>
        The picture to the left is me after I climbed Grey Mare's Tail in Scotland. I went on the school trip to Lockerbie, Scotland which was a remembrance trip for the 35 Syracuse students who died on the Pan Am Flight 103 that exploded over Lockerbie. On this trip, we visited Lockerbie Academy and met with young children who for many heard an American accent for the first time. The following day we were given a tour by a first responder. The last day was the hike up one of the UK's tallest waterfalls, which was breathtaking. And we finished the day with lunch and shopping in a cute little town called Moffat.

    <h1>Budapest, Hungary</h1>
    <p>
        My next trip was to Budapest! The architecture was beautiful. Pictured to the left are my friends and I on a cruise on the Danube River which was stunning. We also went on a ruin bar crawl which was very different from what London's nightlife was like. This place was very rich in culture and was extremely cheap.

    <h1>Vienna, Austria</h1>
    <p>
        What you see to the left is the view from the Belvedere Museum located in Vienna, Austria. I have a lot of family on my mother's side from Austria, so this place has a very special place in my heart. We went to so many museums and beautiful buildings in Vienna. I also had the best wiener schnitzel and bratwurst here! On the plane home, I texted my mother telling her that we need to come back here together.

    <h1>Copenhagen, Denmark</h1>
    <p>
        Copenhagen is pictured on the left. The most friendliest, stylish, and prettiest people I have ever seen live here! I felt so safe walking around the streets and staying in my hostel. If I had to pick a place to move besides London it would be here; however, their language is very difficult to learn.

    <h1>Berlin, Germany</h1>
    <p>
        Ampelmann is the iconic feature you will see throughout Berlin. Berlin is filled with a lot of history. I have a lot of family from Germany so this is another place I hold close to my heart. The first day in Berlin I went on a tour revisiting its past and exploring its memorials of today. The second day I went on another tour which was based around the architecture of the Cold War. Lastly, on the third day I went to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. It was an emotional trip to say the least, but I am so glad that I was able to experience what this city went through.

    <h1>Zurich and Interlaken, Swizterland</h1>
    <p>
        Paragliding in Interlaken, Switzerland!!! This was my favorite country that I went to while abroad. It was a very expensive trip; however, the hospitality, the food, the views, etc. makes it all worth it. I am an adrenaline junky and my next adventurous thing I want to do is go skydiving. We also stayed in Zurich which was such a cute city. The whole place reminded me of a ski city like Aspen or Vail in Colorado. I will definitely be back to ski the Swiss Alps in the future!

    <h1>Porto, Portugal</h1>
    <p>
        What you see to the left is the Douro River in Porto, Portugal. This was my last trip abroad and it was amazing. The weather was beautiful, I was able to wear shorts outside and not have to pack a coat! The best part about this trip was our crazy tuk tuk ride up all the windy roads and a local who barely knew English but wanted to communicate with us so badly. This is a great honeymoon and romantic place to go to.
