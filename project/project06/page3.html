    <h1><u>Budgeting Tips for Studying Abroad</u></h1>
    
    <p class="topparagraph">
        Traveling independently and away from family and friends can be daunting as well as expensive. There are plenty of ways to budget and save money, you just have to be cautious about it and willing to do it. The summer before going abroad, I worked a waitress job and made around $6,000. That was my spending money abroad. That had to cover 3 months of food (groceries, restaurants, etc.), traveling (trains and planes), activities during the day, going out at night, etc. London is not a cheap city at all, but having self discipline sometimes is the best way to save. Buying groceries and cooking for myself was cheaper than ordering food out. Planning weekend trips weeks in advance was cheaper than booking it last minute. Buying tickets for activities a week in advance rather than the day of was also cheaper. These little tips are simple yet so many people don't do it.

        <ul>
            <li>Work</li>
                <ol>
                <li>Before studying abroad, pick up a job and work. If need be, work overtime as well and put all the money you make into a savings account until you go abroad.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Scholarships/Grants/Loans</li>
                <ol>
                <li>
                I applied to several scholarships that were for students going abroad. I ended up winning The Alvin S. Meltzer Endowed Scholarship Fund Award which was awarded on the basis of academic merit. This helped significantly towards my tuition.

    <h2>
        What Can You Do During Abroad To Save Money?
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure that your debit and credit cards are accepted by the country that you will be studying in as well as ensuring that they don't have foreign transaction fees.</li>
        
        <li>Use apps like Skyscanner and Lastminute (check below for pictures) that will check and compare flights across airlines.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Use cheap airlines like WizzAir or RyanAir, but remember you pay for what you get.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>The seats aren't the most comfortable and the service is more relaxed (must check in beforehand or you will get charged money if you wait until checking in at the desk).</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
        <li>Create a planner of how much you are going to allow yourself to spend each week.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>My roommate did this and it was extremely helpful, since she liked to eat out a lot.</li>
    </ul>
        <li>Certain restaurants or businesses prefer cash rather than card.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Sometimes they charge more if you are paying with your card than using cash. I recommend carrying both your credit/debit card and cash. Also, be careful of the currency rates in the different countries.</li>
    </ul>
        <li>Share the costs amongst your roommates.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>My roommates and I would split the cost of toilet paper, paper towels, cleaning supplies, kitchenware, etc.</li>
        <li>You could also save a lot of money if you shared groceries and cooked larger meals at night and shared dinners than individual meals all the time.</li>
    </ul>
        <li>When traveling on the weekends, stay at hostels or cheap airbnb's rather than hotels. Hostels are really fun because you get to interact with other travelers who typically are by themselves.</li>

    <h2>How Much Money Did I Spend Abroad?</h2>
    <p>
        I spent around $5,000/$6,000 within a 4 month study abroad program. I spent most of my money on traveling to other countries on the weekend as well as going out at night for drinks/food. I saved money by cooking at home most days/nights and booking activities in advance as well as taking advantage of student discounts which every country had.
